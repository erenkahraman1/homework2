                <h2>Assos</h2>
                <p>It was founded on the summit and slopes of a volcanic hill at the southern end of the region called Troas in ancient times, opposite the island of Lesbos. The region, which was under the rule of Lydia, Persia, Pergamon and Rome throughout history, was abandoned in the Middle Ages. Aristotle, one of the great thinkers of Antiquity, lived in this city for three years and founded a school of philosophy. Assos was also visited by Paul and for this reason the city is considered sacred by Christians. Founded around 900 BC, the most spectacular place of this city is the Doric Temple of Athena built on the top of the hill. The city also has a large amphitheatre.</p>

                <h2>Troy</h2>
                <p>The Ancient City of Troy, also known as the site of the Trojan War mentioned in Homer's Iliad Epic, was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1998. The city, which is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world with its historical past dating back to 3000 BC, is located within the borders of Çanakkale province. According to the legend of the foundation of Troy, Elektra, the daughter of the sea nymph Thetis and the god of the seas Okeanos, gave birth to Dardanos as the wife of Zeus. Dardanos' son Tros founded the city of Truad and his son Ilus founded the city of Troy.</p>
